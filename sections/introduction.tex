\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Emphasise why separations is important, especially when we want to reach such high purities (especially within the pharmaceutical industry)
    \item Mention an outline of our (hopefully) novel / innovative design and the objective of this separation (purity, isomers, brief economic / environmental considerations)
    \item 1-2 sentences explaining our approach in obtaining our detailed design 
    \item 1 sentence saying what this report outlines (the design methods & our findings)
\end{itemize}
